= DDEX

DDEX metadata serialization for Ruby

<b>DO NOT USE, WORK IN PROGRESS</b>

=== Overview

 require "ddex/ern"

 message = DDEX::ERN.read("path/to/metadata.xml")
 p message.update_indicator
 message.resource_list.each do |resource|
   p resource.title
   p resource.details.size
 end

 include DDEX::ERN::V341   # v3.4.1
 message = NewReleaseMessage.new(hash)
 record  = SoundRecording.new
 record.language_and_script_code = "en-US"
 # ...

 image = Image.new
 image.type = "FrontCoverImage"
 # ...

 message.resource_list << image
 message.resource_list << record
 p message.to_hash

 xml = DDEX::ERN.write(message)
 File.open("bloat.xml", "w") { |io| io.puts(xml) }

=== How this differs from the spec

Every DDEX version handled by this module is fully supported, but there are some things you'll need to know.

==== Naming conventions

DDEX elements and attributes use the {CamelCase naming convention}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase], this module uses Ruby naming conversions:
CamelCase for classes, and {snake_case}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case] for class attributes. For example, this DDEX XML:

  <PartyName>
    <FullName>sshaw</FullName>
  </PartyName>

Would be manipulated via:

  party = PartyName.new(:full_name => "sshaw")
  puts party.full_name
  party.full_name = "gwozdzie"


See also {Boolean elements and attributes}[rdoc-ref:README@Boolean+elements+and+attributes]

==== Cardinally

Elements that _can_ occur more than once will be placed in an <code>Array</code> and their parent classes' accessor methods will use the plural form of
the element/attribute's name. For example:

  <Release>
    <!-- More data -->
    <PLine>
      <Year>1994</Year>
      <PLineText>Track Copyright</PLineText>
    </PLine>
    <PLine>
      <Year>2001</Year>
      <PLineText>Another Track Copyright</PLineText>
    </PLine>
  </Release>

Would be manipulated via:

  release.p_lines.each { |line| puts line.p_line_text }
  release.p_lines << PLine.new(:year => 1999)

<b>There are a few -hopefully obvious- exceptions</b>. If the DDEX name indicates that its a collection, it's left alone.
+SoundRecordingDetailsByTerritory+ and +ResourceList+ come to mind.

==== Boolean elements and attributes

The following are applied to accessors derived from DDEX elements and attributes with an XML schema type of +boolean+:

* <code>"Is"</code> is removed from the beginning of the name
* The *reader* *method* is turned into a predicate accessor, i.e., has a <code>"?"</code> appended to it

For example, <code>SoundRecording/IsArtistRelated</code>:

  recording = SoundRecording.new(:artist_related => true)
  p recording.artist_related?  # true
  recording.artist_related = false

TODO: See Types

=== Development/Contributing/Running Specs

All classes for a particular DDEX version are automatically generated by {jaxb2ruby}[https://github.com/sshaw/jaxb2ruby], which
depends on JRuby. While this is only necessary for code generation it places a JRuby requirement on the bundle, i.e. 
`bundle install` will only work under JRuby.

=== TODO

Many things... but: <code>ROXML.from_xml</code> does not check the root element's name. Need to add something like:

  raise "unknown element #{xml.name}" unless xml.name == tag_name
